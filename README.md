# Heal the Health App

# This is my HealthCare App

## **Objective:-**
  To solve the issue of healthcare record management and outreach of these facilities.

## **Goals:-**
   The main aim of our app is to provide patients with a disease-prediction facility, treatment guidance, etc and doctors with an easy-to-use patient record book.
   
 ## **Methodology:-**
 
To accomplish above mentioned goal I decided to create an app that can help ease the lives of doctors and patients.     
     
he app is built with Flutter and Dart, providing separate interfaces for doctors and patients. Users can log in as either a patient or a doctor. The login and signup pages store user credentials in Firebase, ensuring secure authentication and data storage.

The core feature of the app is disease prediction, powered by machine learning models. These models were trained on medical datasets and converted into APIs using Flask. The app processes user-reported symptoms and predicts potential diseases along with preventive measures. The processed data is stored using Firebase, enabling seamless interaction.

Additionally, the app includes a chatbot that provides health-related assistance. Unlike traditional chatbots, this system is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and symptom-based disease prediction. The chatbot analyzes user symptoms, predicts possible diseases, and offers preventive advice.

This project integrates AI-driven disease prediction and chatbot capabilities, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in healthcare. Future improvements could include advanced interactions like appointment scheduling and reminders.advanced tests) based on inputs given in the form while taking disease prediction test . If the person has a disease then it also suggests dos and don'ts, insurance policies,etc. All the past medical recodrs of the patients are also stored and visible. The patient is also able to maintain a medical diary. The app gives all the desired output to the corresponding inputs. Thus, the app functions the way it should.
